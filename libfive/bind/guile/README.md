# `libfive` bindings for Guile Scheme
_Currently:_ a mix of C++ and Scheme, and building a single dynamic library.

_Soon:_ pure Scheme, using Guile's C FFI and `libfive.dylib`.

(Why?  `(libfive stdlib)` is coming, and needs to use the C FFI,
so might as well solve it for the rest of the bindings as well)
